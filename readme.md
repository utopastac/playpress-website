Built Using Shopify Theme 2.0 - docs here: https://shopify.dev/themes/os20

CSS all constructed from Sass - see styles folder. Currently using `gulp watch` to build the css into theme-new.css locally.

Serve locally with this command: `shopify theme dev --store="playpress"`

The theme is linked to a github repo, which automatically publishes and updates. IF you want to make local changes that aren't pushed, duplicate the them first.

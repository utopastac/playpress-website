Built Using Shopify Theme 2.0 - docs here: https://shopify.dev/themes/os20

Log in to shopify using this command: `shopify login --store playpress`

CSS all constructed from Sass - see styles folder. Currently using `gulp watch` to build the css into theme-new.css locally.

The theme is linked to a github repo, which automatically publishes and updates. IF you want to make local changes that aren't pushed, duplicate the them first.
